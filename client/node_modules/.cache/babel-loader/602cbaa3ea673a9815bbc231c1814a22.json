The AME Zion Church encompasses all of\r\n                      the United States, Canada, Caribbean Islands, England,\r\n                      Africa, India and South America, and it is under the\r\n                      supervision of twelve (12) elected Bishops. The New York\r\n                      Conference, of which we are a part, is a part of the North\r\n                      Eastern Episcopal Area. This Episcopal Area includes New\r\n                      York, Western New York, New England and The Bahamas\r\n                      Conferences.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"bold\">Methodist – It’s Beginning</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHERE: </span> The Methodist Church\r\n                      started in Oxford, England, in the Holy Room on the campus\r\n                      of Oxford University.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHO: </span>John Wesley, an\r\n                      evangelist and his brother, Charles Wesley, a writer.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">WHY: </span>Out of protest. The\r\n                      religion of England was Roman Catholicism, a faith which\r\n                      gives the Pope all the authority in to how one should\r\n                      worship God. The Wesley brothers felt that each individual\r\n                      should be free to worship God at will. So, out of protest,\r\n                      the Protestant Church, which is simply a Christian Church\r\n                      or a group of Christians, split from the Roman Catholic\r\n                      Church in the 16th Century because of a desire to study\r\n                      the bible and worship God in their own way, was organized.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      <span className=\"bold\">HOW: </span> These brothers along\r\n                      with a few other students held services daily in the Holy\r\n                      Room. Other students on the campus; in an attempt to make\r\n                      fun of them, would say, “… there goes those Methodists.”\r\n                      This was in reference to their methodical worship. From\r\n                      the repetition of this scenario, the name “Methodist” was\r\n                      accepted.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p className=\"bold\">What Methodists Believe</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>We believe that all men are sinners.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that God the Father loves all men and hates all\r\n                      sin.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that Jesus Christ died for all men to make\r\n                      possible their salvation from sin through their belief.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that all who repent of their sins and believe\r\n                      in the Lord Jesus Christ receive the forgiveness of sin.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that all that are accepted as the children of\r\n                      God may receive the inward assurance of the Holy Spirit to\r\n                      that fact.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that all that are made “new creatures” in\r\n                      Christ Jesus are accepted as the children of God.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that all who truly desire to seek it may love\r\n                      God with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength and\r\n                      their neighbors as themselves.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that a man born of god is consecrated and set\r\n                      apart for service unto God and that the process of growth\r\n                      begins and is followed by degrees of development ever\r\n                      having as its goal entire sanctification and Christian\r\n                      perfection.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that the gift of the Holy Spirit is possible\r\n                      unto all men as a guide, a teacher and a light.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe in the Kingdom of God which means the reign of\r\n                      God in every area of human life and society.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that all who persevere to the end shall be\r\n                      saved but that souls may lapse from grace and become\r\n                      partially corrupt or even fall wholly away from God and be\r\n                      lost forever.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      We believe that God is eternal and Jesus is the conqueror\r\n                      of the grave and we, being united by faith with Him share\r\n                      His everlasting life.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p className=\"bold\">What Zion Methodists Believe</p>\r\n\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Zion Methodists believe in the basic rules of Methodism.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Zion Methodists believe in the spirit of evangelism and a\r\n                      heat warming experience that operate in the areas of\r\n                      thought, feeling and action.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Zion Methodists believe in the practice of democracy and\r\n                      brotherhood in all relationships.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Zion Methodists believe that every man is a free man and\r\n                      should not be shackled by chains of discrimination and\r\n                      prejudice.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Zion Methodist believes in every man having a full\r\n                      opportunity of exercising his spiritual and natural gifts\r\n                      within the Christian fellowship.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Reference Link:{\" \"}\r\n                      <a\r\n                        className=\"link\"\r\n                        href=\"https://amez.org/\"\r\n                        target=\"_blank\"\r\n                      >\r\n                        {\" \"}\r\n                        AME Zion Website\r\n                      </a>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </Col>\r\n              </Row>\r\n            </Container>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n);\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
