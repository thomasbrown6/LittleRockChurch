                      In America, it is generally conceded that Methodism first
                      shed its light in the city of New York. About the year
                      1765 when a plot of ground on John Street was leased and
                      two years later purchased and the first chapel built.
                      During the entire early struggle of the new organization,
                      Black people figure prominently in Methodism even to
                      devoting of the building for the first organization.
                      Between the years 1765 and 1796 the number of Black
                      members increased greatly. So much so that caste prejudice
                      forbade their taking the Sacrament until the white
                      families were all served. This and the desire for other
                      church privileges denied them induced them to organize
                      among themselves.{" "}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The first church organized in 1796 and built in 1800 was
                      called Zion. The founders chose this name because, “it was
                      the name most frequently used in the Bible to designate
                      the church of God,” even Zion Hill before there was a
                      worship house. Among the leaders of the movement was James
                      Varick, who was the first Bishop and to whom is attributed
                      the founding father of the Zion Church. Zion church was
                      incorporated in 1801 by the name “The African Methodist
                      Episcopal church in New York.” Methodist Episcopal was
                      always in the title to exhibit the retention of the
                      doctrine and form of church government under which the
                      denomination originated. “African” was prefixed to the
                      rest of the title of this church because it was to be
                      controlled by descendants of Africa, in the interest of
                      humanity, regardless of race, color, sex, or condition.
                      Therefore, these people of African descent, with an
                      indubitable pride in the Fatherland and abiding love of
                      kinship, desired to maintain their identity, their ancient
                      cultures and background for posterity. Because another
                      organization came into existence around the same time,
                      with the same title, and so much confusion was brought
                      about, the General Conference of 1848 voted to make ZION a
                      part of the denominational name, henceforth, to be known
                      as the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church.

                      From the very outset the Zion Church has been in the
                      forefront in the battle for full citizenship and freedom
                      in this country. The AME Zion Church encompasses all of
                      the United States, Canada, Caribbean Islands, England,
                      Africa, India and South America, and it is under the
                      supervision of twelve (12) elected Bishops. The New York
                      Conference, of which we are a part, is a part of the North
                      Eastern Episcopal Area. This Episcopal Area includes New
                      York, Western New York, New England and The Bahamas
                      Conferences.

                      <span className="bold">WHERE: </span> The Methodist Church
                      started in Oxford, England, in the Holy Room on the campus
                      of Oxford University.

                    <p>
                      <span className="bold">WHY: </span>Out of protest. The
                      religion of England was Roman Catholicism, a faith which
                      gives the Pope all the authority in to how one should
                      worship God. The Wesley brothers felt that each individual
                      should be free to worship God at will. So, out of protest,
                      the Protestant Church, which is simply a Christian Church
                      or a group of Christians, split from the Roman Catholic
                      Church in the 16th Century because of a desire to study
                      the bible and worship God in their own way, was organized.

                      <span className="bold">HOW: </span> These brothers along
                      with a few other students held services daily in the Holy
                      Room. Other students on the campus; in an attempt to make
                      fun of them, would say, “… there goes those Methodists.”
                      This was in reference to their methodical worship. From
                      the repetition of this scenario, the name “Methodist” was
                      accepted.

                    <p>
                      We believe that God the Father loves all men and hates all
                      sin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We believe that Jesus Christ died for all men to make
                      possible their salvation from sin through their belief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We believe that all who repent of their sins and believe
                      in the Lord Jesus Christ receive the forgiveness of sin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We believe that all that are accepted as the children of
                      God may receive the inward assurance of the Holy Spirit to
                      that fact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We believe that all that are made “new creatures” in
                      Christ Jesus are accepted as the children of God.

                    <p>
                      We believe that all who truly desire to seek it may love
                      God with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength and
                      their neighbors as themselves.

                    <p>
                      We believe that a man born of god is consecrated and set
                      apart for service unto God and that the process of growth
                      begins and is followed by degrees of development ever
                      having as its goal entire sanctification and Christian
                      perfection.

                    <p>
                      We believe that the gift of the Holy Spirit is possible
                      unto all men as a guide, a teacher and a light.

                    <p>
                      We believe that all who persevere to the end shall be
                      saved but that souls may lapse from grace and become
                      partially corrupt or even fall wholly away from God and be
                      lost forever.

                      of the grave and we, being united by faith with Him share
                      His everlasting life.
